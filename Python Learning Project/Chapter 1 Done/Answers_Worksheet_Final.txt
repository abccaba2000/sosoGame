1.
	
	print("My name")

2.

	put '#' at the beginning of comment

3.
	Code			Output
	print(2 / 3)	0.6666666666666666
	print(2 // 3)	0

	'/' means 'division', which is familiar to what we learn in math course. '//' means 'floor division', which will always round the answer down to the nearest integer.

4.

	The way without thinking : 
		pi = 3.14159

	The second way :
		import math
		pi = pi.math

5.

	'A' is differ from 'a' i python, 'a' is not defined so that it cannot be printed.

6.

	'area_of_rectangle' is better one.
	
	The recommended coding style about variable in python is all lowercase and connect the words by underlines.

7.
	Illegal	variable names		Reason of illegal
	1Apple						Must start with a letter or an underscore.
	account number				Shouldn't include space.
	account.number				'.' is preserved to indicate attributes of an object.
	account#					Words behind '#' will be see as comment.
	great.big.variable			'.' is preserved to indicate attributes of an object.
	2x							Must start with a letter or an underscore.
	total%						'%' is mod operator.
	#left						Words behind '#' will be see as comment.

8.

	Variables can not be printed before being defined.

9.

	'3.14' itself is a floating number, no need to cast. But the code will work correctly, no compilation error.

10.

	It is more concise to combine 'x = 3.14' in line 2 and 'pi = x' in line 3 to 'pi = 3.14'; in addition,  
	'radius ** 2' in line 4 is better to be enclosed by parentheses.

11.

	The parentheses which elcose 'x' and 'y' are redundant.

12.

	The operator between '3' and '(x + y)' in line 3 is lost.

13.

	"Enter the radius" should be the input of 'input' function, not 'float'. There should be some input before converting them to float numbers.

14.

	All of them print the same value, but the code in line 2 is better, because there is always a space between number and operator, which is the coding style Python community perferred (elegant!).

15.

	A variable that value never changes.

16.

	Letters in the names of constants are all uppercase, of variable are all lowercase.

17.

	Single quote : '	ex : 'example'
	Double quote : "	ex : "example"

18.

	print('\"\r\n')

19.

	Yes. Single quote and double quote are interchangeable in python.

20.

	The precedence of division operator is higher than addtion operator.
	The code should be revised as "print((3 + 4 + 5) / 3)".

21.

	The sign which can manipulate the value of operands.

22.

	The program will print '3'.

23.

	Revised code :

		user_name = input("Enter your name: ")

24.

	Revised code :

		value = int(input("Enter your age"))
