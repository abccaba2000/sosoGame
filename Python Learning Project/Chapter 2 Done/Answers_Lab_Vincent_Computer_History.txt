The only episode I watched was episode 3. Without subtitle, it's hard to fully understand the context. But I still got some point to share below :
	
1. User Interface
	Computers are powerful, but if you want them be popular, it should be easy-to-use. It's a tradeoff, for most people won't bring a box never seen home to confuse themselves. So you can see not only Apple, MS and Xerox as well were trying to improve the user interface, so the pointing device, "mouse"; the output device, what-you-see-is-what-you-print "laser printer"; and the graphical user interface, "GUI" were introduced. Jobs said "Picture rather than words", while graphical interface is common nowadays, what's rather than picture?
	
2. Good artist copy, great artist steal
	I had read this sentence several weeks ago, in a news introducing Steve Jobs, and today I heard the sentence from him in the video. It's an interesting saying, shouldn't be understood the sentence literally. To copy others work directly is banned by IP laws, but we may learn the concept or even spirit, and adapt them to our work. It's hard to create a totally new thing or concept, so don't miss the option to steal one.

3. Software
	More applications are more adventages, every people nowadays know it. But at that time in the video, it seemed only Bill Gates knew it. 

4. Mananger vs Researchers
	When Xerox notice the "paperless future", the researchers in the company was encouraged to find out the solution, and they invented modern PC. Combine WYSIWYP laser printer, mouse, and GUI, the new-concept computer was promising, but the manager couldn't realize the value of it in the future. It's frustrating, I know the feeling, and I know it's inevitable, only history sighs.
