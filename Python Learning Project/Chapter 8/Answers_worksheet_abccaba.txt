1. 
	since every time before we draw the rectangle, we set the position to the same value.
2. 
	rect_y: the y value of the position of the left-up point of the rectangle
	rect_x: the x value of the position of the left-up point of the rectangle
	rect_change_y: the y value of change of position of the rectangle
	rect_change_x: the x value of change of position of the rectangl
3.
	If it is a rectangle, check when the y posiotion of the left-up point is at 380
4. 
	We should inverse the direction the shape move, not the position
5.
	We can use a pair of variable to maintain the position of one part of the figure, and calculate positions of other parts according to this pair.
6.
	Since there is not a star with a trackable position
7.
	Store their posiotions in a list
8. 
	print(stars[1][0])
9.
	Since the pygame.draw.circle takes the a list containing position information, which snow_list[i] suffice.
10.
	It uses sin and cos to calculate the posiotion of the end point of the line.
