1.

	The location of the stick figure cannot be specified because none of the drawing function has at least one variable argument.

2.

	import pygame

	BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
	WHITE = (255, 255, 255)

	pygame.init()

	size = [500, 600]
	screen = pygame.display.set_mode(size)

	pygame.display.set_caption("Sosogame")

	done = False

	clock = pygame.time.Clock()

	while not done :

		for event in pygame.event.get() :
			if event.type == pygame.QUIT :
				done = True


			# Grab the position of mouse
			mouse_pos = pygame.mouse.get_pos()
			
			# Just print x coordinate
			print(mouse_pos[0])

		pygame.display.flip()

		clock.tick(100)

	pygame.quit()

	If the event processing loop is splitted into two parts, the former code block will process all the events in the event queue, remain nothing for the latter code block.

4.

	If we multiply -1 to 'speed' variable while we are moving something by keyboard, the direction control setting will be modified.

	For example, we usually define speed negative as going left while pressing left arrow key. If we multiply -1 to the speed while the object touching the boundary, the left arrow key will then make the object go right hand side.

5.

	Mouse is always 'somewhere' on the screen.

6.

	If it means 'joystick', the return value would be [1, 1]
