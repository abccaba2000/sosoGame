2 Write a Python program that will take in a number from the user and printif it is positive, negative, or zero. Use a proper if/elif/else chain, don'tjust use three if statements.

    number = float(input("please input a number: "))
    if number < 0:
        print("It is negative")
    elif number == 0:
        print("It is zero")
    else:
        print("It is positive")

3 Write a Python program that will take in a number from a user and printout ``Success'' if it is greater than -10 and less than 10, inclusive. (1 pt)
    
    number = float(input("please input a number: "))
    if number >= 10 and number <= 10:
        print("Success")

user_input = input("A cherry is a: ")

print("B. Desert topping")
if user_input.upper() == "A":
print("Correct!")
else:
print("Incorrect.")

    need indentations in line 5 and line 6
    the input function should be placed after stating the two choices


5 There are two things wrong with this code that tests if x is set to apositive value. One prevents it from running, and the other is subtle.Make sure the if statement works no matter what x is set to.Identify both issues. (2 pts)

9 Look at the code below. Write your best guess here on what it will print.Next, run the code and see if you are correct.Clearly label your guess and the actual answer.Also, if this or any other example results in an error, make sure tostate that an error occurred.While you don't need to write an explanation, make sure you understandwhy the computer prints what it does. Don't get caught flat-footed whenyou need to know later. (2 pts)
